MistralLLM - Local Specialized Language Model
==========================================

.. warning::
   This component is currently under construction and may undergo significant changes.

The ``MistralLLM`` class will provide a specialized implementation of the ``BaseLLM`` interface that uses local Mistral models, optimized specifically for sales conversation and lead qualification tasks.

Future Class Overview
--------------------

.. code-block:: python

   class MistralLLM(BaseLLM):
       """
       LLM implementation that uses local Mistral models.
       """
       
       def __init__(self, model_path: str, gpu_layers: int = 0):
           """
           Initialize the Mistral LLM.
           
           Args:
               model_path (str): Path to the local model weights
               gpu_layers (int): Number of layers to offload to GPU
           """
           # Implementation details to come

Planned Features
---------------

- **Local Execution**: Run the model entirely on-premises without API dependency
- **Domain Specialization**: Fine-tuned specifically for sales conversations
- **Customizable Parameters**: Control over model behavior and performance
- **GPU Acceleration**: Configurable GPU offloading for performance optimization
- **Lower Latency**: Faster response times than cloud-based solutions
- **Offline Support**: Function without internet connectivity

Implementation Roadmap
--------------------

1. **Initial Integration**: Basic integration with ctransformers
2. **Performance Optimization**: GPU acceleration and latency improvements
3. **Fine-tuning Pipeline**: Specialized model training for sales conversations
4. **Extended Context Window**: Support for longer conversations
5. **Information Extraction Improvements**: Enhanced extraction of lead details

Advantages for Our Use Case
--------------------------

The ``MistralLLM`` implementation will provide several key advantages for our specific lead qualification and sales conversation use cases:

- **Domain-Specific Training**: The model can be fine-tuned with sales conversation data
- **Custom Behavior**: Greater control over conversation flow and information extraction
- **Reduced Operating Costs**: No API usage fees for high-volume deployments
- **Data Privacy**: All data processing remains local
- **Performance Consistency**: Stable performance without reliance on external services

Integration with Existing Systems
--------------------------------

When completed, ``MistralLLM`` will integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture through the ``BaseLLM`` interface. This will allow easy switching between OpenAI and Mistral implementations using the factory pattern already in place.

Dependencies
-----------

The implementation will require:

- **ctransformers**: High-performance inference framework
- **Mistral Weights**: Pre-trained model weights
- **CUDA** (optional): For GPU acceleration
